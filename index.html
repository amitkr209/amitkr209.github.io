    <p>
        Hi, I’m Amit Kumar — an experienced Project Coordinator and Data Analyst passionate about data-driven decision-making and effective project management. My journey began during my college days, where I pursued a Bachelor's degree in Commerce with Honors from Delhi University. Alongside academics, I started working as a Subject Matter Expert, helping students with complex accounting and economics problems. This early experience instilled in me a love for problem-solving and analytical thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
        After graduation, I stepped into the corporate world as a data analyst, where I honed my skills in data collection, cleaning, and analysis. Over time, I took on leadership roles, managing teams of analysts and driving projects to successful completion. I also explored freelancing opportunities, working as a data analyst for a YouTube channel, where I applied my expertise to create actionable insights and impactful visuals for content strategy.
    </p>
    <p>
        As I advanced in my career, I embraced project management, taking on responsibilities for planning, coordination, and execution of projects using Agile and Scrum methodologies. My ability to manage resources, optimize processes, and deliver high-quality outcomes has consistently enhanced project success rates. To further expand my skill set, I pursued certifications in Data Analytics, Project Management, and Business Intelligence from Coursera, ensuring I remain at the forefront of industry standards.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond my professional endeavors, I am a creative individual who finds inspiration in sketching, traveling, and playing video games. These hobbies fuel my creativity and help me maintain a balanced and holistic perspective, enabling me to tackle challenges with a fresh outlook.
